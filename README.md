# Apple-care

This project is a Point Of Sale system (POS) and inventory tracker for an Apple products (iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, etc.) dealership.<br>
You can customize the code base of this project to meet your needs. (I'll try my best to add more comments to the codes, my bad ðŸ¥²). <br>
This is a full stack Javascript project, and hence just a fair knowledge of javascript is enough to understand the codebase.<br>
NB: Tech Stack : <b>Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB, ejs template</b>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Code Editor (VS Code, Sublime, Bracket, etc.)</li>
<li>Node and npm installed on your machine.</li>
<li>MongoDB server. Click <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/">here</a> to install MongoDB on your system.</li>
<li>Internet connection to download project dependencies</li>
</ul>

Let's get started on how to run this project.
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clone this repository using the command line, or download the zip file and open the project folder in your code editor.</li>
<li>Navigate to the projects root folder from your system's command line, or VS code's terminal.</li>
<li>Run <b>npm install</b> to download all dependencies for this project.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<ol>
<li>Download and install MongoDB on your system. You can either run <b>MongoDB</b> as a service or Manually.</li>
<li>Start the <b>MongoDB</b> server, but make sure you have created a folder to store your Database files.</li>
<li>Go back to your code editor (VS Code) and open the terminal, type <b>node server.js</b> and hit enter.</li>
<li>You should see a message with the text "Server started on port 3000" in your console / terminal.</li>
<li>Go to any web browser on your machine, type localhost:3000 and hit Enter.</li>

</ol>
